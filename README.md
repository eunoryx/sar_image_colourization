# SAR Image Colorization with U-Net CNN

This project aims to colorize Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to enhance the interpretability of monochromatic SAR data by learning to generate colorized images using paired SAR and optical images as training data.


## Instructions to Run the Streamlit App

1.  Clone the repository:

	`git clone https://github.com/eunoryx/sar_image_colourization`

2. Open the directory:
	
	`cd sar_image_colourization/st_app`

3. Make sure you have streamlit installed:

	`pip install streamlit`
	
4. Run the Streamlit app:

    	`streamlit run app.py`
